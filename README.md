# thesisCodeDNA
This repo contains code and DNA text files for generating patterns.

It is a record of the programming associated with my Thesis project at ITP in 2016. The work would not be possible without my consulting programmer, J.H Moon.
I am using DNA sequences mapped to visuals in order to generate patterns which I can 3D print from.
